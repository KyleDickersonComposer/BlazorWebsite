        Layer one is a Debussy-inspired wash of impressionistic sea-images.
        Layer two is a rousing fanfare with complex transitional logic to manage different types of action and
        stingers. Layer three is a complete action set piece with aggressive orchestration and swirling motions.
        The basic idea of the demo is based around the usage of transitional logic and stingers.
        The overall effect is designed to give the impression of a swashbuckling sea-voyage with many twists and
        turns.
        Stingers have the ability to interrupt the action and might even steer the playback of the music down a
        different track in response to the conditional logic and the design of the audio implementation.
        An event-based concept allows for more complex combinations of musical ideas.
        Similarly to component-based architectures in web UI frameworks or in Unity, you can recombine scripts and
        have them interact with each other.
        This change in orientation allows for vast new swaths of territory to explore!
